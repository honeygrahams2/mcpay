## Incident Response Process

Maintainers will respond to security incidents as fast as possible, and will keep you informed of our progress.

McPay is a community project, and we are grateful for security researchers and responsible disclosure. We currently do not have a bug bounty program as the project is non-profit, open-source and volunteer-maintained.
